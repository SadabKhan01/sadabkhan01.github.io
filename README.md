## Documentation

This portfolio site is a static HTML/CSS/JS project hosted on GitHub Pages:

- **Home**: Introduction with quick links to other sections.  
- **About**: Bio, photo, education, volunteer work, hobbies (with cat images), and skills.  
- **Projects**: future projects
- **Contact**: A clean form with JavaScript feedback, plus resume download and social links.  

All styling lives in `assets/css/styles.css`, and interactivity (footer year, form handling) in `assets/js/main.js`.  
To run locally, just open `index.html` in your browser. Pushing to `main` auto-deploys via GitHub Pages.
